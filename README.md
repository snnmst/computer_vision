## 🧠 Projects

Here are some of the exciting computer vision studies / hands-on practises I've been working on:

### 1. **🖼️ Image Classification (CIFAR-10)**
   - **Description**: A project focused on classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 📊
   - **Technologies**: TensorFlow, Keras
   - **Accuracy**: 88.51% (After data augmentation) 🎯
   - **Link**: [CIFAR-10 Classification](./cifar10_classification)
   - **Notebook**: coming soon!

### 2. **🔍 Object Detection (YOLOv5)**
   - **Description**: Applied **YOLOv5** to detect multiple objects in real-time from webcam feed. 🚗👕
   - **Technologies**: PyTorch, OpenCV
   - **Link**: [Object Detection with YOLOv5](./yolov5_object_detection)
   - **Notebook**: coming soon!

### 3. **🌟 Image Segmentation (U-Net)**
   - **Description**: Created a segmentation model to identify and segment specific regions in medical images (e.g., tumors in CT scans). 🏥🧠
   - **Technologies**: Keras, U-Net, Python
   - **Link**: [Image Segmentation](./image_segmentation)
   - **Notebook**: coming soon!

### 4. **👁️ Facial Recognition (FaceNet)**
   - **Description**: Developed a facial recognition system to match and identify faces across different images. 👩‍💻👨‍💼
   - **Technologies**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, FaceNet
   - **Link**: [Facial Recognition](./facial_recognition)
   - **Notebook**: coming soon!
